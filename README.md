Discrete-event Simulator for a P2P cryptocurrency network
=====================

## Installation Instructions

To install the required packages, run the following commands:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
sudo apt install graphviz
```

## Compilation and Execution
To compile :
```sh
make 
```
You can change the simulation parameters in args.json file.
```
num_peers:              Number of peers in the network
num_slow_peers:         Number of slow peers
num_low_cpu:            Number of peers with low cpu
Tdij:                   d_ij is randomly chosen from an exponential distribution with mean (Tdij kbits/c_ij)
avg_blks_interarrival:  I in the problem statement
max_blocks:             Simulation is stopped once the #blocks in the blockchain reaches this value
Ttx:                    The interarrival between transactions generated by any peer is chosen from an exponential distribution with mean time Ttx

```
To run the simulation :
```
make run
```
After running the simulation this will create a directory named `blockchains`. In that You can find `.dot` and `.png` files corresponding to blocktrees
at all peers.

Use `make clean` to remove all the object files and blockchain data generated.
